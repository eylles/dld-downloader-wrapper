A wrapper for cli file transfer programs, no longer think about having to use
[megatools](https://megatools.megous.com/) for a mega link,
[aria2c](https://github.com/aria2/aria2) or just good ol
[curl](https://curl.se/).


Mind you this script is very opinionated in how it operates, it requires
configuration to be implemented or to edit the code (it's suckless bro!!!) for
the flags on stuff like aria.

Compatible with [mega-wrap](https://github.com/eylles/mega-wrap)
